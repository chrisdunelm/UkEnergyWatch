    <div class="infotitle">About - Electricity</div>
    <p>Electricity in the UK is generated from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Large power stations within the UK.</li>
        <li>Electrical interconnects with France, Ireland and the Netherlands.</li>
        <li>Small-scale generation within the UK. Generally this is wind, solar or hydro-electric generation
            owned by private individuals or businesses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Large power stations can be categorised by which fuel they use to generate electricity, as shown in the table above.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        <b>Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT):</b>
        A CCGT power plant uses two separate generation processes:
        <i>(a)</i> A gas turbine powered by natural gas is directly connected to an electrical generator; and
        <i>(b)</i> The hot waste gases from the gas turbine are used to generate steam to power a second electrical generator.
        By combining these two processes in a single power plant the efficiency of the conversion of chemical energy
        (in the fuel) to electrical energy can be increased to almost 60%, albeit at a modest increase in complexity and cost.
        All recent gas-powered power stations will be CCGT, rather than Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT).
        Although a CCGT power plant is the most efficient design of fossil-fuel power station that exists,
        they still emit large quantities of carbon dioxide, adding to the effects of climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT):</b>
        An OCGT power station is one of the simplest and cheapest power plants, powered by natural gas,
        with a gas turbine connected to an electrical generator.
        However, the waste gases from the gas turbine hold a considerable amount of heat energy that is thrown away,
        unlike in a CCGT power plant. This waste of energy causes an OCGT to be inefficient.
        There are very few OCGT power stations in the UK. Almost all gas powered plants are now the more efficient CCGT design.
        As natural gas is a fossil fuel, an OCGT power plant emits large quantities of carbon dioxide, adding to the effects of climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Oil:</b>
        Oil power stations burn fuel refined from crude oil.
        In the UK there are very few purely oil-fired power stations, but there are a number of duel-fired power stations;
        these are capable of burning oil and coal, or oil and gas.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Coal:</b>
        Coal power stations burn coal to boil water, producing steam which drives a steam turbine which is connected to an electrical generator.
        These are the least efficient and most polluting of all types of power station in the UK and produce the most CO<sub>2</sub>
        (and other pollutants) per unit of electricity of all fuels.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Nuclear:</b>
        Nuclear power stations generate electricity from heat generated from nuclear fission.
        This generates no immediate atmospheric pollution, including generating no CO<sub>2</sub>;
        however it does generate radioactive waste that is dangerous over periods of 100 to 10,000 years,
        depending on the type of nuclear power station that generated them and what reprocessing has been performed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Wind:</b>
        Wind power is a CO<sub>2</sub>-free power source which generates no atmospheric pollution at all during operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pumped Storage Hydro:</b>
        Pumped-storage is used for storing electricity, and it is the only currently viable method of storing
        useful amounts of electricity for use on the national electricity grid.
        Water is pumped from a lower reservoir to a higher reservoir during periods of low national electricity demand,
        and then released to drive power-generating turbines from the high reservoir during times or high or rapidly rising electrical demand.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Non Pumped Storage Hydro:</b>
        Hydro-electricity is a CO<sub>2</sub>-free power source which generates no atmospheric pollution at all during operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Interconnects:</b>
        The UK national grid has four interconnects which allow importing and exporting electricity internationally.
        These are used when UK electricity demand is significantly different to the demand of the connected country;
        or when the current price of electricity in each country makes it beneficial to trade electricity.
        <ul>
            <li>A 2,000MW interconnect to France. 4x 500MW high-voltage direct-current cables between Sellindge (near Folkstone)
                in England and Les Mandarins in France. The cables are 70km long, with 45km of that under the sea.
                Began operating in 1986.</li>
            <li>A 1,000MW interconnect to the Netherlands, consisting of one 260km high-voltage direct-current cable between
                the Isle of Grain in England and Maasvlakte in the Netherlands. Began operating in 2011.</li>
            <li>Two interconnects to Northern Ireland.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p><b>CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions</b></p>
    <p>
        Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) produces CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon Dioxide).
        The quantity of fossil fuels used needs to be reduced for many reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The CO<sub>2</sub> produced contributes towards climate change; significantly disrupting life for future generations on our planet.</li>
        <li>Many other pollutants apart from CO<sub>2</sub> are produced, especially from coal.</li>
        <li>Fossil fuels are non-renewable - they will run out.</li>
        <li>As fossil fuels become scarcer, the techniques used for producing them become more 'dirty'.
            More pollution is caused by mining the fossil fuel before the fuel is even used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Notice that electricity generation in the UK produces between four and seven tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>
        every second (depending on the time of day).
        This is approximately 200 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> every year.
    </p>
    <p><i>This is a lot.</i></p>
